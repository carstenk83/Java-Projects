# Login-Stats

Design and implement a program that allows a user to learn more details about logins to a remote computer system.
In any multi-user computer system, several users can be logged in at the same time. Moreover, the same user can be logged 
in simultaneously using different terminals. Every time a user loggs in, or loggs out, a record of it is written to a log 
file. Only one user can be logged in using any given terminal at any given time. But once a user loggs out, another user 
can log in using the same terminal. The purpose of this project is to design a program that interacts with such a log file 
and presents the results to a user in a human readable form.
